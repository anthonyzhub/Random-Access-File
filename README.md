# Random-Access-File

Hi,

This academic project was assigned to me as a Sophmore a few years ago, when I was enrolled in a course called Object Oriented Programming. This C++ program demonstrates my ability to read and write a random access file on a computer. Below, I have listed the requirements that were needed to complete the assignment. Please, feel free to use this as a reference.

# Requirements
1. Write a program using a class that has data members `ID number, Name, Salary, Year_Hired`.
2. 10 blank records must be written to the random access file. 4/10 blank records must have data in them
3. Allow the user to output the name, salary, hired date for a selected record
4. Allow the user to change the name, salary, or hired date for a selected record
5. Allow the user to input a complete record to replace one of the blank records
